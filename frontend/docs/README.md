# README

A cleaned and improved version of the project documentation for the EV web project.

## Project Overview

This project contains a small website built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript showcasing an EV-related demo (images included). The corrected files in this repository ensure modern HTML structure, responsive meta tags, and basic JS/CSS syntax fixes.

## What I changed

- Ensured `<!DOCTYPE html>` and `<meta charset>` are present in HTML files.
- Moved scripts to the end of `<body>` where appropriate.
- Fixed unbalanced braces/parentheses in CSS/JS where detected.
- Improved formatting and added this README.

## How to run

1. Unzip the project and open `index.html` (or the main HTML file) in a web browser.
2. No build step is required for this simple static site.

## Development notes

- If you add new JS libraries, include them before your main JS file.
- Test in browser console for runtime errors.
