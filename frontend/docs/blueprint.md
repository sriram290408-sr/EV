# BLUEPRINT

Project blueprint and implementation notes (improved).

## Goal

To create a simple, responsive informational website related to EV (electric vehicle) topics. The repository includes HTML, CSS, JS and images.

## Structure

- `index.html` — main page
- `css/` — stylesheet(s)
- `js/` — javascript files
- `img/` — images used by the site

## Improvements to make next

- Add accessibility improvements (alt text, ARIA landmarks).
- Split CSS into components and consider a small reset/normalize.
- Add basic unit tests for JS logic (if any complex logic exists).

## Deployment

Host as static site (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel).
